# ASL Flash Card Application
A Python-based flash card application designed to help users learn American Sign Language (ASL). This project uses a polished, image-based interface built with Tkinter and leverages Selenium to look up ASL signs on Google. The app tracks your progress over time, adapting the frequency of flash cards based on your performance.
